# Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and reporting.

## Organization
- Use numbered prefixes for notebooks that should be run in sequence (e.g., `01_data_exploration.ipynb`)
- Use descriptive names that indicate the notebook's purpose
- Consider organizing by project phase or analysis type

## Best Practices
- Keep notebooks focused on a single topic or analysis
- Include markdown cells to document your thinking and findings
- Clear all outputs before committing to git (or use nbstripout)
- Move reusable code to the `src/` directory
